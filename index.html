	<h2>Intro</h2> 

	<p> My name is Ally DiOrio. I am from Atlanta, GA and I attended <a href="https://www.lovett.org/">The Lovett School</a>. I have one older sister, Jessica, who also went to UGA and now lives in Atlanta and works for KPMG on their IT Audit team. My dad has just recently retired from working with Accenture and my mom now volunteers at Atlanta's High Museum. My family is 100% Italian. My mom's maiden name is Procopio and her mom's maiden name is Cocodrilli. My dad's side of the family is from Gubio, Italy and my mom's side is from Vienna.

	<h2>Big Italian Family</h2>

	<p> A common <a href="http://www.italia.it/en/home.html">Italian</a> tradition is a family dinner every Sunday night. And by family, I mean <em>ALL</em> family. Cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great grandparents, you name it. On Sundays, our meals vary from my grandma's famous lasagna, rigatoni pasta with bolognese sauce, gnocchi with tomato sauce, or ravioli.

	<h2> Conclusion</h2>

	<p>
	Overall, my family is very close. We spend lots of time together and family is always put before all else. My sister and I are best friends - we shop together, we eat together, we text all the time while I am at school, and we call each other at least 3 times a week. I genuinely couldn't imagine not being close with my family members and I treasure every minute we spend together.
